So we talk a lot about breaking up the big banks and I don't want to take anything away from that notion because its an excellent topic all on its own, but what about breaking up the big political parties?

Ok ok, its not possible you say.  But what if it was?  What if instead of allowing an independent to split the vote of mostly one party why not ease into the process of breaking the two party system by having four candidates?  What if we split both parties?  Bernie could run on the Democratic Socialist ticket and Cruz would run for the Tea Party.

Of course there are lots of arguments against this, people say the party which divides more will undoubtedly lose, or that it would cause some sort of rift in the time-space continuum or something.  Personally, I think that our current electoral college system is much more suited to this type of competition.

This leaves a lot of questions of course, but we will never know the answers unless we try.  Would it have to be an even number of candidates so the parties would tend to split more 'fairly'?  What if Kasich decided to throw his hat in the ring too?  This year really feels like the year that no candidate could run away with an unconventional election like this.

Think about it, in 2016 these races are so close with voter turnout so high there has never been a better time to #breakupthebigparties

Oh, and just think of all the cool infographics they could do with 5 different colors 8-O
